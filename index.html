    <h1>TFT Breakdown</h1>
    <p>Teamfight Tactics is a strategy based autobattler. Through making different decisions compared to the 7 other players in your lobby, you do your best to place in the top 4, or top 1 if you are feeling especially lucky. One of the core concepts in this game is economy - managing when to level up, what items you wish to build, and what units to "roll down" leads to a wide variation of gameplay. Different units have synergies with other units from the same tribe, and every few months a new "set" comes out which brings massive changes - updating the roster of units you can select, the structure of the game, and the "set mechanic", a new concept added to each set. For more information, see the below link:</p>

    <p>Introduced in the 6th set, "Augments" were a decision making point where one decided among three different ways to improve the power of their build - through generating more money, making it easier to level up, or giving the ability for spells to "crit" to the full team. As one of the most popular mechanics, it became "evergreen", introduced in each set afterwards as part of the game. It dramatically increased inter-game variance, and allowed players who enjoyed risk to chase strange and interesting compositions. And I enjoyed TFT for all of this - the flexible decision making, the mix-and-match board structure, and the array of augments which focused my team on specific synergies. Unfortunately, Set 8 went against this.</p>
    <p>The central mechanic of Set 8 was hero augments - the ability to choose between having your "hero" unit support the team, or supercharge their own ability. One of these "Hero Augments" replaced an "Augment". It was one of the most controversial set mechanics in the game. This was for a few reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It limited team diversity, as one was forced to field a specific unit on their team, likely for the full game.</li>
        <li>"Tailoring" the board to make it more likely to receive the hero augment you wished for was common, which meant making strange decisions such as weakening your board for a turn to get the augments you wanted</li>
        <li>Balance issues meant several augments were far stronger than others, and it was difficult to balance a total of over 100 augments to increase comp variation over a set that lasted a few months and patched every 2 weeks</li>
        <li>At the first augment selection, you could potentially be "forced" to play a comp based on the hero augment with no ability to "pivot" - play something different across the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So on the whole, I was waiting for Set 9 with bated breath, hoping that it would restore what I found fun about TFT. And that's what it did.</p>
