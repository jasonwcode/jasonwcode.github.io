    <title>TFT - Looking to Set 9</title>

    <p>I was waiting for Set 9 with bated breath, hoping that it would restore what I found fun about TFT. And that's what it did.</p> 
    <p>One of the core tenets of Set 9 seemed to be reducing variance outside the players' control and to bring more decisions within their control.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As a whole, the variety of "hero augment" selections was dramatically reduced, and you could see regular augments as well in your augment selection screen. If you didn't like the playstyle of hero augments, it was very easy to ignore.</li>
      <li>"Legends" allowed you to guarantee an augment at each of 3 augment decision points, guaranteeing the ability for anyone to play a playstyle they enjoyed before the game started.</li>
      <li>Units got more "flavorful" synergies, with regions like "Zaun" providing special chemtech modifications to your units, or Freljord freezing the board.</li>
      <li>Regions were "random but democratic", allowing each player to cast a vote for a specific region at the start of the game with special effects.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I loved these changes, as they enhanced most of the high moments while reducing the low moments - if you liked more items, more synergies, more economy, more power, each legend could offer that to you.</p>
    <p>At the moment, Set 9 is still in beta, and it will only be released a week from now. However, I am looking forward to the new set greatly, and hope this document explains why.</p>
